# Dynamo System - Microservice Migration Plan

This document outlines the strategy and implementation plan for migrating the Dynamo System from a monolithic architecture to a microservice-based architecture.

## 1. Current Architecture Analysis

### Monolithic Components
- **Authentication & User Management**: Centralized auth system with role-based access
- **Forms Module**: Form building, rendering, and response collection
- **Projects Module**: Project management and user assignments
- **Tasks Module**: Task creation, assignment, and tracking
- **Notifications Module**: User notification system (WIP)

### Current Integration Points
- Shared database (Supabase PostgreSQL)
- Unified frontend React application
- Common authentication context
- Edge Functions for server-side operations

## 2. Target Microservice Architecture

### Proposed Services
1. **API Gateway Service**
   - Entry point for all client requests
   - Authentication and request routing
   - Rate limiting and request validation

2. **Auth Service**
   - User authentication and session management
   - Profile management
   - Role-based access control

3. **Projects Service**
   - Project CRUD operations
   - Project user management
   - Project-level permissions

4. **Forms Service**
   - Form builder functionality
   - Form template management
   - Form response collection and storage

5. **Tasks Service**
   - Task management
   - Task templates
   - Task assignments and status tracking

6. **Notifications Service**
   - User notifications
   - Email integration
   - Notification preferences

7. **Analytics Service** (Future)
   - Form response analytics
   - User activity tracking
   - System usage metrics

### Service Communication
- REST APIs for synchronous communication
- Event-based messaging for asynchronous operations
- Shared authentication tokens

## 3. Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Preparation (Months 1-2)
- Set up microservice infrastructure
- Define service boundaries and APIs
- Create service templates and scaffolding
- Implement API Gateway prototype

### Phase 2: Strangler Pattern Implementation (Months 3-6)
1. **Extract Notifications Service** (Month 3)
   - Lowest coupling with existing system
   - Create standalone notifications database
   - Implement notification API
   - Update frontend to use new notification endpoints

2. **Extract Auth Service** (Month 4)
   - Implement standalone auth service
   - Migrate user profiles and authentication
   - Update API Gateway to validate tokens

3. **Extract Projects Service** (Month 5)
   - Implement Projects API
   - Migrate project data
   - Update dependent services to use Projects API

4. **Extract Forms Service** (Month 6)
   - Implement Forms API
   - Migrate form templates and responses
   - Update frontend to use Forms API

### Phase 3: Complete Migration (Months 7-9)
1. **Extract Tasks Service** (Month 7)
   - Implement Tasks API
   - Migrate task data
   - Update frontend to use Tasks API

2. **Analytics Service** (Month 8)
   - Implement initial analytics capabilities
   - Set up data collection from other services

3. **Decommission Monolith** (Month 9)
   - Verify all functionality in microservices
   - Redirect all traffic through API Gateway
   - Gracefully shut down monolithic application

## 4. Technical Implementation Plan

### Database Strategy
- **Pattern**: Database-per-service
- **Implementation**:
  - Create separate Supabase projects for each service
  - Implement data migration scripts
  - Set up initial data synchronization during transition

### Service Implementation
- **Technology Stack**:
  - Node.js/Express or FastAPI for service implementation
  - Supabase for database and authentication
  - Docker for containerization
  - Kubernetes for orchestration

### Environment Strategy
- Extend current dev → QA → prod workflow to each service
- Implement centralized configuration management
- Service-specific environment variables

### CI/CD Pipeline
- Separate build pipelines for each service
- Coordinated deployment strategy
- Automated testing at service boundaries

## 5. Environment-Specific Considerations

### Development Environment
- Local service development with Docker Compose
- Service mocking for cross-service development
- Development-specific feature flags

### QA Environment
- Full microservice deployment
- Integration testing across services
- Performance testing under realistic loads

### Production Environment
- Blue/green deployment strategy
- Canary releases for critical services
- Enhanced monitoring and observability

## 6. Rollout and Testing Strategy

### Testing Approach
- Unit tests for individual services
- Integration tests for service interactions
- End-to-end tests for critical user flows
- Performance testing for each service

### Rollout Strategy
- Gradual feature migration
- Parallel running of monolith and microservices
- Feature toggles for rollback capability
- Phased user migration

## 7. Monitoring and Observability

### Monitoring Infrastructure
- Centralized logging system
- Distributed tracing across services
- Service health dashboards
- Alert system for service degradation

### Key Metrics
- Service response times
- Error rates
- Resource utilization
- Business KPIs

## 8. Risk Management

### Potential Risks
- Service communication failures
- Data consistency issues
- Performance degradation
- Development team adaptation

### Mitigation Strategies
- Circuit breakers and fallback mechanisms
- Consistent data validation across services
- Performance testing at each phase
- Team training and documentation

## 9. Team Structure and Responsibilities

### Proposed Team Organization
- Platform Team: Infrastructure, CI/CD, shared components
- Service Teams: Service-specific development and maintenance
- Integration Team: Cross-service functionality and testing

### Knowledge Transfer
- Documentation of service boundaries and APIs
- Internal workshops on microservice patterns
- Pair programming during initial service development

## 10. Next Steps

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Create detailed API specifications for each service
   - Set up containerization infrastructure
   - Implement API Gateway prototype
   - Design database migration strategy

2. **Decision Points**:
   - Technology stack finalization
   - Service boundary confirmation
   - Team restructuring approach
   - Migration timeline approval
